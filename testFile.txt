Considered white trash by many, Die does whatever she needs, including strutting her body in front of male employers who will look, to make an honest living. That bread-winning ability is affected when she makes the decision to remove her only offspring, fifteen year old Steve Despr√©s, from her previously imposed institutionalization, one step below juvenile detention. She institutionalized him shortly following her husband's death due to Steve's attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and his violent outbursts. He was just kicked out of the latest in a long line of facilities for setting fire to the cafeteria, in turn injuring another boy. She made this decision to deinstitutionalize him as she didn't like the alternative, sending him into more restrictive juvenile detention from which he would probably never be rehabilitated. However, with this deinstitutionalization, she has to take care of him which means only being able to do home based work. Despite they always yelling expletives at each other and Steve sometimes demonstrating those violent tendencies toward her, Die and Steve truly do love each other, his emotions which are sometimes manifested as an Oedipus complex especially as he seems to need her complete attention most specifically when it is being directed at possible male suitors. Their lives, both individually and as a family, are affected with the entrance of two of their neighbors. The first is Paul, a lawyer, who does have that sexual interest in Die as he tries to help Steve through his legal problems. The second and more important is Kyla, who lives across the street with her husband Patrick and their adolescent daughter, they who are in transit in their life to wherever Patrick's job will take them. Kyla is a high school teacher on sabbatical as she deals with her own emotional issues, which are manifested in stuttering whenever she feels incapable of dealing with her life. Kyla may find that she needs the Despr√©s as much as they need her.","Director":"Xavier Dolan","Title":"Mommy","Actors":"Anne Dorval, Suzanne Cl√©ment, Antoine Olivier Pilon, Patrick Huard","imdbRating":"8.1","imdbVotes":"30,438","Response":"True","Runtime":"139 min","Type":"movie","Awards":"49 wins & 58 nominations.","Year":"2014","Language":"French, English","Rated":"R","Poster":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMjE3NjMwMjc3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDk4MjA0MzE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Country":"Canada","Genre":"Drama","Writer":"Xavier Dolan (screenplay)"}{"Released":"11 Sep 2014","Metascore":"78","imdbID":"tt1745787","Plot":"A deaf teenager enters a specialized boarding school where, to survive, he becomes part of a wild organization - the tribe.

From his unmistakable bullish frame came a scathingly ribald stand-up style that took early audiences by force. Through stark, smart observation and judo-like turns of phrase, Crimmins's rapid-fire comedy was a war on ignorance and complacency in '80s America at the height of an ill-considered foreign policy. Crimmins discusses another side of his character, revealing in detail a dark and painful past that inspired his life-changing campaign of activism in the hope of saving others from a similar experience. Interviews with comics like Margaret Cho and Marc Maron illustrate Crimmins's love affair with comedy and his role in discovering and supporting the development of many of today's stars. As a venerated member of America's comic community, Crimmins could be your newest national treasure.

As such, he captures the imagination of his students, at least in the classroom. Outside of the classroom, Dan's life is in shambles. He has a distant but cordial relationship with his family. He uses illicit drugs rampantly. Although his former girlfriend Rachel was able to clean up her drug habit, Dan believes that rehab will not work for him. Due to a combination of these issues, he treats women poorly. Thirteen year old Drey is a student in his class and a player on his basketball team. Drey has her own problems. Her parents are divorced, with her father a virtually non-existent figure in her life and her EMT mother generally absent as she is always working to provide for Drey. Her older brother Mike is incarcerated for selling drugs for a local dealer named Frank. Mike took the fall for Frank, who in turn protects Drey whether she wants to be associated with him or not. Dan and Drey's relationship changes when Drey catches Dan, believing he is alone, smoking crack in the girl's locker room bathroom. He is totally stoned. Their resulting friendship, which is seen as inappropriate by the few who know, is based on each being unable to deal with their own life, but feeling like they can be at least a minor salvation in the other's life.","Director":"Ryan Fleck","Title":"Half Nelson","Actors":"Ryan Gosling, Jeff Lima, Shareeka Epps, Nathan Corbett","imdbRating":"7.2","imdbVotes":"72,772","Response":"True","Runtime":"106 min","Type":"movie","Awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar.

First of all, Gelsomina, at twelve years of age, practically runs the family. Her three younger sisters obey her and work under her watchful eye. But the outside world mustn't know anything about their lifestyle, and they should be kept away from it, well-protected in their isolated countryside home. Gelsomina's father, Wolfgang, is a foreigner and Gelsomina is the future queen of this strange and improbable kingdom he has constructed for them. A male heir would have been better, of course, but Gelsomina is strong and determined and what's more, she has a special talent for beekeeping and making honey. It's Gelsomina that retrieves the swarms from the trees, who organizes the honey extraction, and she is the one that carries the hives. Whilst all around them the countryside is being burnt up by pesticides, rural life is falling apart and becoming something different, a TV show competition arrives from the city offering a cash prize and a luxury cruise for the Most Traditional Family. \"Village Wonders\" is presented by the good fairy, Milly Catena. Gelsomina wants to participate in the contest, but Wolfgang won't even consider it. Something else is tormenting him: the new European laws regarding farm produce. If they don't get their honey lab in order, with washable walls and well-defined working spaces, they will have to cease production. They have to work very hard to expand the bee colonies, and get the lab up to standard. In his desperate search for cheap labor, Wolfgang agrees to take on a delinquent German boy, Martin, who comes from a youth rehabilitation exchange program. The tension mounts: between a silent evasive boy onto whom Wolfgang projects his desire for a son, and, counteracting this, the outward reaching force of Gelsomina that will stop at nothing just in order to see the good fairy TV show hostess again. Nothing will be the same at the end of this summer for Gelsomina and her family.

The '20s are roaring. Liquor is flowing, bullets are flying, and one man sets out to make his mark on the world. Prohibition has given rise to an endless network of underground distilleries, speakeasies, gangsters, and corrupt cops. Joe Coughlin, the youngest son of a prominent Boston police captain, has long since turned his back on his strict and proper upbringing. Now having graduated from a childhood of petty theft to a career in the pay of the city's most fearsome mobsters, Joe enjoys the spoils, thrills, and notoriety of being an outlaw. But life on the dark side carries a heavy price. In a time when ruthless men of ambition, armed with cash, illegal booze, and guns, battle for control, no one-neither family nor friend, enemy nor lover-can be trusted. Beyond money and power, even the threat of prison, one fate seems most likely for men like Joe: an early death. But until that day, he and his friends are determined to live life to the hilt. Joe embarks on a dizzying journey up the ladder of organized crime that takes him from the flash of Jazz Age Boston to the sensual shimmer of Tampa's Latin Quarter to the sizzling streets of Cuba. Live by Night is a riveting epic layered with a diverse cast of loyal friends and callous enemies, tough rumrunners and sultry femmes fatales, Bible-quoting evangelists and cruel Klansmen, all battling for survival and their piece of the American dream. At once a sweeping love story and a compelling saga of revenge, it is a spellbinding tour de force of betrayal and redemption, music and murder, that brings fully to life a bygone era when sin was cause for celebration and vice was a national virtue.","Director":"Ben Affleck","Title":"Live by Night","Actors":"Ben Affleck, Elle Fanning, Remo Girone, Brendan Gleeson","imdbRating":"6.9","imdbVotes":"3,420","Response":"True","Runtime":"128 min","Type":"movie","Awards":"1 nomination.","Year":"2016","Language":"Spanish, English","Rated":"R","Poster":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMjc3MDIyMjgzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzUxOTg3MDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Country":"USA","Genre":"Crime, Drama","Writer":"Ben Affleck (screenplay), Dennis Lehane (based on the novel by)"}{"Released":"17 Nov 2016","Metascore":"90","imdbID":"tt5247022","Plot":"A quiet observation of the triumphs and defeats of daily life, along with the poetry evident in its smallest details.","Director":"Jim Jarmusch","Title":"Paterson","Actors":"Adam Driver, Golshifteh Farahani, Nellie, Rizwan Manji","imdbRating":"7.7","imdbVotes":"7,313","Response":"True","Runtime":"118 min","Type":"movie","Awards":"6 wins & 24 nominations.","Year":"2016","Language":"English","Rated":"R","Poster":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTUzODA4Nzk0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE1MDIwMDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Country":"USA, France, Germany","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Writer":"Jim Jarmusch"}{"Released":"17 Mar 2017","Metascore":"N\/A","imdbID":"tt2062700","Plot":"Two intersecting love triangles.

Because of these issues, Chiron is bullied, the slurs hurled at him which he doesn't understand beyond knowing that they are meant to be hurtful. Besides his same aged Cuban-American friend Kevin, Chiron is given what little guidance he has in life from a neighborhood drug dealer named Juan, who can see that he is neglected, and Juan's caring girlfriend Teresa, whose home acts as a sanctuary away from the bullies and away from Paula's abuse. With this childhood as a foundation, Chiron may have a predetermined path in life, one that will only be magnified in terms of its problems when he reaches his difficult teen years when peer pressure affects what he and many of his peers do, unless he follows Juan's advice of truly making his own decisions for himself.","Director":"Barry Jenkins","Title":"Moonlight","Actors":"Mahershala Ali, Shariff Earp, Duan Sanderson, Alex R.
