Considered white trash by many, Die does whatever she needs, including strutting her body in front of male employers who will look, to make an honest living. That bread-winning ability is affected when she makes the decision to remove her only offspring, fifteen year old Steve Despr√©s, from her previously imposed institutionalization, one step below juvenile detention. She institutionalized him shortly following her husband's death due to Steve's attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and his violent outbursts. He was just kicked out of the latest in a long line of facilities for setting fire to the cafeteria, in turn injuring another boy. She made this decision to deinstitutionalize him as she didn't like the alternative, sending him into more restrictive juvenile detention from which he would probably never be rehabilitated. However, with this deinstitutionalization, she has to take care of him which means only being able to do home based work. Despite they always yelling expletives at each other and Steve sometimes demonstrating those violent tendencies toward her, Die and Steve truly do love each other, his emotions which are sometimes manifested as an Oedipus complex especially as he seems to need her complete attention most specifically when it is being directed at possible male suitors. Their lives, both individually and as a family, are affected with the entrance of two of their neighbors. The first is Paul, a lawyer, who does have that sexual interest in Die as he tries to help Steve through his legal problems. The second and more important is Kyla, who lives across the street with her husband Patrick and their adolescent daughter, they who are in transit in their life to wherever Patrick's job will take them. Kyla is a high school teacher on sabbatical as she deals with her own emotional issues, which are manifested in stuttering whenever she feels incapable of dealing with her life. Kyla may find that she needs the Despr√©s as much as they need her.","Director":"Xavier Dolan","Title":"Mommy","Actors":"Anne Dorval, Suzanne Cl√©ment, Antoine-Olivier Pilon, Patrick Huard","Response":"True","Type":"movie","Awards":"49 wins & 59 nominations.","DVD":"N\/A","Year":"2014","Poster":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMjE3NjMwMjc3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDk4MjA0MzE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Country":"Canada","Genre":"Drama","Writer":"Xavier Dolan (screenplay)"},{"Metascore":"78","BoxOffice":"$76,637","Website":"http:\/\/drafthousefilms.com\/film\/the-tribe","imdbRating":"7.1","imdbVotes":"7,711","Ratings":[{"Value":"7.1\/10","Source":"Internet Movie Database"},{"Value":"89%","Source":"Rotten Tomatoes"},{"Value":"78\/100","Source":"Metacritic"}],"Runtime":"126 min","Language":"Ukrainian, Sign Languages","Rated":"UNRATED","Production":"Drafthouse Films","Released":"11 Sep 2014","imdbID":"tt1745787","Plot":"A deaf teenager enters a specialized boarding school where, to survive, he becomes part of a wild organization - the tribe.

Despite the most advanced medical technology in the world, we are sicker than ever by nearly every measure. Cases of diabetes are exploding, especially amongst our younger population. About half of us are taking at least one prescription drug and major medical operations have become routine. Heart disease, cancer and stroke are the country's three leading causes of death, even though billions are spent each year to \"battle\" these very conditions. Millions suffer from a host of other degenerative diseases. Could it be there's a single solution to all of these problems? A solution so comprehensive, but so utterly straightforward, that it's mind-boggling that more of us haven't taken it seriously? FORKS OVER KNIVES examines the profound claim that most, if not all, of the so-called \"diseases of affluence\" that afflict us can be controlled, or even reversed, by rejecting our present menu of animal-based and processed foods. The major storyline in the film traces the personal journeys of Dr. T. Colin Campbell, a nutritional scientist from Cornell University, and Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, a former top surgeon at the world renowned Cleveland Clinic. Inspired by remarkable discoveries in their young careers, these men conducted several groundbreaking studies, one of which is considered among the most comprehensive health-related investigations ever undertaken. Their research separately and independently led them to the same startling conclusion: degenerative diseases like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and even several forms of cancer, could almost always be prevented-and in many cases reversed-by adopting a whole foods, plant-based diet. Despite the profound implications of their findings, their work has remained relatively unknown to the public. In addition, cameras follow \"reality patients\" who have chronic conditions from heart disease to diabetes. Doctors teach these patients how to adopt a whole foods plant-based diet as the primary approach to treat their ailments-while the challenges and triumphs of their journeys are revealed.","Director":"Lee Fulkerson","Title":"Forks Over Knives","Actors":"Lee Fulkerson, Matthew Lederman, Alona Pulde, T.

Lured by tales of weight lost and health regained, they begin to uncover hidden sides of animal agriculture that make them wonder whether solutions offered in films like Food, Inc. go far enough. Before long, they find themselves risking everything to expose an industry they supported just weeks before. But can their convictions carry them through when times get tough? What about on family vacations fraught with skeptical step-dads, carnivorous cousins, and breakfast buffets?

Using her stories' grandmotherly heroine, Doreen Marcus, as her inspiration, Tess decides that the best course of action is revenge, and figuring out a way not to get caught.

But once you've experienced Bobcat Goldthwait's brilliant character portrait of him and heard Crimmins's secret, you will never forget him. From his unmistakable bullish frame came a scathingly ribald stand-up style that took early audiences by force. Through stark, smart observation and judo-like turns of phrase, Crimmins's rapid-fire comedy was a war on ignorance and complacency in '80s America at the height of an ill-considered foreign policy. Crimmins discusses another side of his character, revealing in detail a dark and painful past that inspired his life-changing campaign of activism in the hope of saving others from a similar experience. Interviews with comics like Margaret Cho and Marc Maron illustrate Crimmins's love affair with comedy and his role in discovering and supporting the development of many of today's stars. As a venerated member of America's comic community, Crimmins could be your newest national treasure.

He uses illicit drugs rampantly. Although his former girlfriend Rachel was able to clean up her drug habit, Dan believes that rehab will not work for him. Due to a combination of these issues, he treats women poorly. Thirteen year old Drey is a student in his class and a player on his basketball team. Drey has her own problems. Her parents are divorced, with her father a virtually non-existent figure in her life and her EMT mother generally absent as she is always working to provide for Drey. Her older brother Mike is incarcerated for selling drugs for a local dealer named Frank. Mike took the fall for Frank, who in turn protects Drey whether she wants to be associated with him or not. Dan and Drey's relationship changes when Drey catches Dan, believing he is alone, smoking crack in the girl's locker room bathroom. He is totally stoned. Their resulting friendship, which is seen as inappropriate by the few who know, is based on each being unable to deal with their own life, but feeling like they can be at least a minor salvation in the other's life.","Director":"Ryan Fleck","Title":"Half Nelson","Actors":"Ryan Gosling, Jeff Lima, Shareeka Epps, Nathan Corbett","Response":"True","Type":"movie","Awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar.

A company called Zomcon has been able to control the zombie population. Zombies can be temporarily neutralized by being shot, but can only be permanently neutralized by their brain being destroyed. Their ultimate disposal is through cremation, or burial, the latter which requires decapitation with the head being buried separately from the body. Conversely, Zomcon has created the domestication collar, when activated and placed on a zombie makes the zombie controllable and thus an eternally productive creature within society. Because all dead initially become zombies, the elderly are viewed negatively and suspectly. And all people, adult or child, learn to shoot to kill to protect society. Zomcon is the go to organization for all things zombie. In the town of Willard, the Robinsons - father Bill, mother Helen, and adolescent son Timmy - are one family who don't own a zombie as a domestic since Bill is afraid of zombies, as, when he was a child, he had to shoot his own zombie father, who tried to eat him. Bill has thus become fascinated with funerals to see zombies put away permanently. But Helen feels pressured to get a zombie when Zomcon's new head of security in Willard, the officious Jonathan Bottoms, moves into the neighborhood with his family. Never having had to deal with a zombie directly, Timmy is initially wary of their zombie. But as a lonely child who has no friends and is often bullied, Timmy eventually befriends their zombie, who he names Fido, as he treats the zombie much like a faithful pet dog. Timmy protects Fido at all cost, even after Fido, due to no fault of its own, is implicated in some deaths, which creates a mini-wave of loose zombies unknown to Zomcon. But Fido may play a larger role within the family as a companion for Helen, who is largely neglected by Bill, since he sees human affection as ultimately resulting in such difficult issues as what happened between him and his own father. With Timmy and Helen treating Fido with kindness, Fido, in turn, may prove that not all zombies, even when without their domestication collar, are out to kill anyone and everyone in their path.","Director":"Andrew Currie","Title":"Fido","Actors":"David Kaye, Jan Skorzewski, Kevin Tyell, Andy Parkin","Response":"True","Type":"movie","Awards":"13 wins & 15 nominations.","DVD":"N\/A","Year":"2006","Poster":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BNzQwMzYyMDQtZTc1Yi00YzU4LThlM2ItYTM5Mjc5NGViNjRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Country":"Canada","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Horror","Writer":"Robert Chomiak, Andrew Currie, Dennis Heaton, Dennis Heaton (original story)"},{"Metascore":"36","BoxOffice":"$20,524,319","Website":"http:\/\/myspace.com\/theinvisiblemovie","imdbRating":"6.3","imdbVotes":"31,927","Ratings":[{"Value":"6.3\/10","Source":"Internet Movie Database"},{"Value":"20%","Source":"Rotten Tomatoes"},{"Value":"36\/100","Source":"Metacritic"}],"Runtime":"102 min","Language":"English","Rated":"PG-13","Production":"Buena Vista","Released":"27 Apr 2007","imdbID":"tt0435670","Plot":"Nick Powell is an excellent high-school student who raises money by selling homework and results of quizzes to his schoolmates.

First of all, Gelsomina, at twelve years of age, practically runs the family. Her three younger sisters obey her and work under her watchful eye. But the outside world mustn't know anything about their lifestyle, and they should be kept away from it, well-protected in their isolated countryside home. Gelsomina's father, Wolfgang, is a foreigner and Gelsomina is the future queen of this strange and improbable kingdom he has constructed for them. A male heir would have been better, of course, but Gelsomina is strong and determined and what's more, she has a special talent for beekeeping and making honey. It's Gelsomina that retrieves the swarms from the trees, who organizes the honey extraction, and she is the one that carries the hives. Whilst all around them the countryside is being burnt up by pesticides, rural life is falling apart and becoming something different, a TV show competition arrives from the city offering a cash prize and a luxury cruise for the Most Traditional Family. \"Village Wonders\" is presented by the good fairy, Milly Catena. Gelsomina wants to participate in the contest, but Wolfgang won't even consider it. Something else is tormenting him: the new European laws regarding farm produce. If they don't get their honey lab in order, with washable walls and well-defined working spaces, they will have to cease production. They have to work very hard to expand the bee colonies, and get the lab up to standard. In his desperate search for cheap labor, Wolfgang agrees to take on a delinquent German boy, Martin, who comes from a youth rehabilitation exchange program. The tension mounts: between a silent evasive boy onto whom Wolfgang projects his desire for a son, and, counteracting this, the outward reaching force of Gelsomina that will stop at nothing just in order to see the good fairy TV show hostess again. Nothing will be the same at the end of this summer for Gelsomina and her family.

Michael Burry, an eccentric ex-physician turned one-eyed Scion Capital hedge fund manager, has traded traditional office attire for shorts, bare feet and a Supercuts haircut. He believes that the US housing market is built on a bubble that will burst within the next few years. Autonomy within the company allows Burry to do largely as he pleases, so Burry proceeds to bet against the housing market with the banks, who are more than happy to accept his proposal for something that has never happened in American history. The banks believe that Burry is a crackpot and therefore are confident in that they will win the deal. Jared Vennett with Deutschebank gets wind of what Burry is doing and, as an investor believes he too can cash in on Burry's beliefs. An errant telephone call to FrontPoint Partners gets this information into the hands of Mark Baum, an idealist who is fed up with the corruption in the financial industry. Baum and his associates, who work at an arms length under Morgan Stanley, decide to join forces with Vennett despite not totally trusting him. In addition to Burry's information, they further believe that most of the mortgages are overrated by the bond agencies, with the banks collating all the sub-prime mortgages under AAA packages. Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley, who are minor players in a $30 million start-up garage company called Brownfield, get a hold of Vennett's prospectus on the matter. Wanting in on the action but not having the official clout to play, they decide to call an old \"friend\", retired investment banker Ben Rickert, to help out. All three of these groups work on the premise that the banks are stupid and don't know what's going on, while for them to win, the general economy has to lose, which means the suffering of the general investor who trusts the financial institutions. That latter aspect may not sit well with Baum. Some of these assumptions may be incorrect and may be far more manipulative than they could have ever imagined, which in turn may throw curves into the process.","Director":"Adam McKay","Title":"The Big Short","Actors":"Ryan Gosling, Rudy Eisenzopf, Casey Groves, Charlie Talbert","Response":"True","Type":"movie","Awards":"Won 1 Oscar.

Mild-mannered Slough bank manager Jamie is in a rut - albeit a very organised one - consumed by grief for his missing wife. All of that soon changes, however, when he's arrested on suspicion of cyber terrorism and realises that, somehow, he must have an identical twin and that his mum Paula has some serious explaining to do.

At the Vatican, meanwhile, foul-mouthed rebel priest Father Jude interviews the beautiful Sister Celine for a role in his office of the Devil's Advocate. These are just some of the eclectic and seemingly unconnected characters whose lives will start to intersect in the most unexpected ways as news breaks that a comet is on an unavoidable collision course towards earth and will hit in just 34 days. Some of them are destined to make it to a bunker deep beneath the suburbs of Slough and, as a result, will become the hugely unlikely (and, frankly, somewhat unsuitable) future of mankind.","Director":"N\/A","Title":"You, Me and the Apocalypse","Actors":"Mathew Baynton, Jenna Fischer, Joel Fry, Gaia Scodellaro","imdbRating":"7.8","imdbVotes":"5,480","Ratings":[{"Value":"7.8\/10","Source":"Internet Movie Database"}],"Response":"True","Runtime":"30 min","Type":"series","Awards":"N\/A","Year":"2015","Language":"English","Rated":"N\/A","Poster":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTgzMzQyMzQ5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzU3NDAxNzE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Country":"UK, USA","Genre":"Comedy","Writer":"Iain Hollands"},{"Metascore":"82","BoxOffice":"N\/A","Website":"N\/A","imdbRating":"7.9","imdbVotes":"12,673","Ratings":[{"Value":"7.9\/10","Source":"Internet Movie Database"},{"Value":"82\/100","Source":"Metacritic"}],"Runtime":"125 min","Language":"Spanish, Portuguese, Aboriginal, German, Catalan, Latin, English","Rated":"NOT RATED","Production":"N\/A","Released":"25 May 2015","imdbID":"tt4285496","Plot":"The story of the relationship between Karamakate, an Amazonian shaman and last survivor of his people, and two scientists who work together over the course of 40 years to search the Amazon for a sacred healing plant.","Director":"Ciro Guerra","Title":"Embrace of the Serpent","Actors":"Nilbio Torres, Jan Bijvoet, Antonio Bolivar, Brionne Davis","Response":"True","Type":"movie","Awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar.

It is the middle of the 20s and times are troubled since the already fragile equilibrium of secrecy between the unseen world of wizards and the ordinary or \"No-Maj\" people that the MACUSA Congress struggles to maintain, is at risk of being unsettled. In the meantime, the voices against wizardry keep growing with daily protests led by Mary Lou Barebone and fuelled by the increasing disasters ascribed to a dark wizard, Gellert Grindelwald. At the same time, by a twist of fate, Newt's precious suitcase will be switched with the identical one of an aspiring No-Maj baker, Jacob Kowalski, while demoted Auror, Tina Goldstein, arrests Newt for being an unregistered wizard. To make matters worse, with the suitcase in the wrong hands, several creatures manage to escape to unknown directions. Before long, this situation will catch Senior Auror Percival Graves' attention who will target both Tina and Newt amid panic caused by an invisible, devastating and utterly unpredictable menace that still wreaks havoc in New York's 5th Avenue.

Although reluctant to see his poetic prose trimmed, Wolfe agreed and was helped by Perkins, who had become a true friend, with the result that it instantly became a favorite with the critics and a best seller. Success was even greater in 1935 when \"Of Time and the River\" appeared, but the fight for reducing Wolfe's logorrheic written expression had been even harder, with the novel originally at 5,000 pages. Perkins managed to cut 90,000 words from the book, and with bitterness ultimately taking its toll, the relationships between the two men gradually deteriorated. Wolfe did not feel grateful to Perkins any longer but had started resenting him for owing his success to him.","Director":"Michael Grandage","Title":"Genius","Actors":"Colin Firth, Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, Laura Linney","Response":"True","Type":"movie","Awards":"1 win & 5 nominations.","DVD":"06 Sep 2016","Year":"2016","Poster":"https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMjMwNzM3NzY0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMwMjQ1ODE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Country":"UK, USA","Genre":"Biography, Drama","Writer":"John Logan (screenplay), A.
